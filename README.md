# Fake Image Detection using MobileNet Algorithm with UI

## Overview
This repository contains code and resources for detecting fake images using the MobileNet algorithm. MobileNet is a lightweight deep learning architecture optimized for mobile and embedded vision applications. The project includes a user interface (UI) to facilitate easy prediction of whether an image is real or fake.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Flask (for UI)
- Pillow (PIL)
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gokulaarimuthu/fake-image-detection.git
    cd fake-image-detection
    ```


## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of real and fake images collected from various sources, including online repositories and synthetic data generation tools. Due to privacy and copyright concerns, the dataset is not included in this repository. However, you can obtain it from [provide the source or instructions for obtaining the dataset].

## Usage
1. **Training:** Train the MobileNet model using the preprocessed dataset. You can fine-tune the pre-trained MobileNet model or train from scratch depending on your requirements and dataset size.

2. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained model on a separate test set to assess its performance in detecting fake images. Compute metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model's effectiveness.

3. **UI Deployment:** Deploy the model with a user interface using Flask or any other web framework. Users can upload images through the UI to get predictions on whether they are real or fake.

4. **Visualization (Optional):** Visualize model predictions and performance metrics using Matplotlib or any other visualization library. This can help in understanding the model's behavior and identifying areas for improvement.
